# AirBnb Booking Analysis (EDA)

The Airbnb Booking Analysis project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Airbnb booking data to uncover patterns in customer behavior, booking trends, and factors that influence pricing and availability. This analysis covers key attributes such as guest demographics, booking times, property types, pricing strategies, and cancellation rates. By extracting insights from the data, the project aims to help hosts optimize their listings, improve guest satisfaction, and develop data-driven strategies for enhancing booking performance and revenue growth. Additionally, customer segmentation will assist in personalizing services and targeting marketing efforts effectively.
