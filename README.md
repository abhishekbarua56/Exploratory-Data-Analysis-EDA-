# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Airbnb Dataset

## Project Description

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Airbnb dataset. The primary objective is to uncover insights into Airbnb listings, host characteristics, pricing strategies, and other relevant trends. By visualizing the data and performing statistical analysis, this project seeks to provide a deeper understanding of the Airbnb marketplace and help stakeholders make informed decisions.

## Objectives

- To analyze the Airbnb dataset and identify trends and patterns in the listings.
- To visualize key metrics, including price distributions, availability, and review scores.
- To uncover relationships between variables such as location, price, and number of reviews.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment for running Python code and visualizing results.
- **Pandas**: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computations that complements Pandas.
- **Matplotlib**: A library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **Seaborn**: A statistical data visualization library built on Matplotlib for enhanced aesthetics.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is obtained from [insert dataset source], containing the following key features:

- **Listing_ID**: Unique identifier for each Airbnb listing.
- **Host_ID**: Unique identifier for the host.
- **Neighborhood**: Neighborhood where the listing is located.
- **Price**: Price per night for the listing.
- **Review_Scores**: Ratings provided by guests.

## Key Steps and Methods

### Data Preprocessing

- **Handling Missing Values**: Addressed missing data through imputation or removal as necessary.
- **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned and formatted columns for consistent analysis (e.g., converting price strings to numerical values).
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features based on existing data to enhance analysis, such as price per person.

### Exploratory Analysis

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarized the dataset to understand distributions and central tendencies.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigated relationships between numerical variables to identify significant correlations.
- **Group Analysis**: Analyzed data by categories (e.g., neighborhood, room type) to uncover trends.

### Visualizations

- **Price Distribution**: Visualized the distribution of prices using histograms and boxplots.
- **Location Insights**: Created maps to show the density of listings in different neighborhoods.
- **Trend Analysis**: Plotted trends over time to examine how prices and availability fluctuate.

## Instructions to Run the Project

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhishekbarua56/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
```

Open the Jupyter Notebook (My_Final_AirBnb_EDA.ipynb) in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells in order.

## Usage Examples

The following code snippet demonstrates how to load the dataset and perform initial data exploration:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('airbnb_data.csv')

# Display the first few rows
print(data.head())

# Summary statistics
print(data.describe())
```

## Results

The EDA revealed key insights into the Airbnb marketplace, including:

- The most popular neighborhoods for listings.
- Price distribution trends and outliers.
- Relationships between review scores and pricing strategies.

Visualizations and detailed findings can be found throughout the Jupyter Notebook.

## Future Improvements

- **Advanced Analysis**: Explore machine learning techniques for price prediction and recommendation systems.
- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Implement methods to gather real-time data for ongoing analysis.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: Create an interactive dashboard to present findings to stakeholders in an accessible format.
